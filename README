In all the four Python files, you can create your own sources using Gaussian r.v. to model the interval between two successive peaks and the sinus function to model the shape of the curves outside of the peaks. The ```plot_sources.py``` file will show you how these sources behave.  

Once the sources are generated, you can compute the signals of each subjects, using mixing matrices sampled from a Gaussian distributions. Then, you can perform ICA in order to reconstruct the sources. Three different ICA algorithms are proposed: MVICA, GroupICA and UniviewICA. 

The evaluation of the quality of the reconstruction is done using the Amari distance. The quality of the reconstruction will depend on the lag of the subjects. 

The effect of this lag on the mixing matrices is represented in the file ```plot_permutation_matrices.py``` where we plot the matrices W^i A^i for 4 subjects with and without lag. Ideally, these matrices should represent the same permutation and scale matrice but it isn't the case when there is a lag.
